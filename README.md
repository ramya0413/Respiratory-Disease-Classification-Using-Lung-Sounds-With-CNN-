# Respiratory Disease Classification Using Lung Sounds with CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the automatic classification of respiratory diseases using lung sound recordings and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Respiratory audio signals are processed, converted into spectrogram-based features, and classified into different lung disease categories using deep learning.

The system aims to assist medical diagnosis by providing accurate, fast, and automated disease prediction from respiratory sounds.
