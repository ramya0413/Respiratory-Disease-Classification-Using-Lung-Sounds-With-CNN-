# Respiratory-Disease-Classification-Using-Lung-Sounds-With-CNN-
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify respiratory diseases by analyzing lung sound recordings. Audio signals are converted into spectrograms, enabling accurate detection of conditions like asthma, pneumonia, and COPD through deep learning.
